0.87 - 2008-02-14
-----------------
This new version brings two major features to SemanticScuttle:

1) You can now create a synonym link between tags.
   For example, by linking the tags "monument" and "monuments",
   you can find resources tagged with the first one when you navigate
   through the second one. More important, this link works with
   the inclusion link already implemented.
2) Users can create commune descriptions for tags and bookmarks.
   In a small community, the idea is to bring gradually people to work
   together (if they want it). From a research perspective, we explore
   the bridge between individual actions (easy to do) and collaborative
   ones (more difficult but more powerful).

All the changes:

- Interface design: allow to access to users' bookmarks from last
  user sidebox. (Currently, we can just access to their profiles).
- Interface design: hide multiple URLs repeated into history page
- Interface design: hide About link for logged users
- New feature: Collaborative spaces (like wiki) for descriptions
  of tags and bookmarks
- Interface fix: improve the creation of structured links
- New feature: Allow the creation of synonym links between tags


0.86 - 2008-01-24
-----------------
- Bug fix: correct antispam question feature
- Interface design: normalize URL when adding
  (remove final "/")
- Interface design: group similar URL
- Interface bug fix: improve linked relations into structured links box
- Interface bug fix: improve display of structured tags into alltags
  and populartags page (problem of div size)


0.85 - 2008-01-22
-----------------
- New feature: Add stats (nb children, nb descendants, depth,
  nb update) to structured tags

  - Allow to visualize structured tags according to stats
  - Add admin page to update stats from the existing structured
    tags in the database

- Translation: improve French translation (add missing translations,
  transform "labels" into "tags")
- New feature: List all users in a users page and users block on
  the front page
- Interface design: Transform recent bookmarks into last bookmarks
  on front page (to avoid blank front page)
- Interface design: Add structured tags in a right box on the front page
- New feature: Antispam question to register
- New feature: Allowing a subtitle message, managable in the
  configuration file.
- Interface design: Redesign menu (search box, sort buttons, top
  and right menu)
